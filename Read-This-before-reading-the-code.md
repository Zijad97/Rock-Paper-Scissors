# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I realized that i didn't have to create rock,paper,scissors functions.I could have called the game function after the if statements with corresponding indexes,basically:
if (id === "rock") game(0);
  if (id === "paper") game(2);
  if (id === "scissors") game(1);
which would have resulted in much shorter code :)
